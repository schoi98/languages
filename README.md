# languagues
Repo for learning different programming languages

## My Process

This is how I am currently trying to learn languages.
- Learn basics from sources like: [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)
- Do a full-fledged, non-trivial project (Build a multithreaded webserver, build an interpreter, etc)
- Fail and learn from chatGPT or [Onboard AI](https://getonboard.dev/) along the way.
- Keep using it


## Building Blocks of a language

1. Core Components
- Syntax and Semantics: 
- Type System: Static vs. Dynamic, strong vs. weak, primitive types, complex types; type inference, prelude to generics, constraints
- Memory Management: manual, reference counting, garbage collection, how it interacts with types.
- Unique features: rust-ownership, functional languages-monads, java-oop structuring

2. Execution Model
- Control Flow Constructs: conditionals, loops, functio calls, pattern matching, custom control structures.
- Function and Procedure Abstraction: functions, anonymous functions, higher order functions, closures.
- Concurrency and Parallelism: parallel execution, async/await, threads, concurrent data structures.

3. Advanced Features
- Error Handling and Safety: exceptions, errors. safety features such as ownership, python dynamic and reflective capabilities
- Networking and I/O: I/O calls, networking, user interaction

4. Modularity and Reusability
- Modules and Namespaces: Modules, namespaces, packaging etc.
- Object-Oriented Features: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- Metaprogramming and Generics: programs that generate code and type safety with generics

5. Compilation and Runtime
- Compilation/Interpretation
- Runtime Environment

6. Ecosystem
- Standard library
- Package manager

Project:
- CLI REPL (I/O, error handling, parsing, stdlib)
- Multithreaded Webserver (Concurrency, package manager, networking)
- Special Project (Interpreter, Lambda calculus evaluator, Operating System, Auto-diff library, etc...)
