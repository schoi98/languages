# languagues
Repo for learning different programming languages

## My Process

This is how I am currently trying to learn languages.
- Learn basics from sources like: [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)
- Do a full-fledged, non-trivial project (Build a multithreaded webserver, build an interpreter, etc)
- Fail and learn from chatGPT or [Onboard AI](https://getonboard.dev/) along the way.
- Keep using it
