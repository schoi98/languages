1. Core Components
- Syntax and Semantics: 
```clojure
(operator operands)
```
...
- Type System: Static vs. Dynamic, strong vs. weak, primitive types, complex types; type inference, prelude to generics, constraints
Clojure is a dynamically typed, ...

- Memory Management: manual, reference counting, garbage collection, how it interacts with types.

- Unique features: rust-ownership, functional languages-monads, java-oop structuring


2. Execution Model
- Control Flow Constructs: conditionals, loops, functio calls, pattern matching, custom control structures.

- Function and Procedure Abstraction: functions, anonymous functions, higher order functions, closures.

- Concurrency and Parallelism: parallel execution, async/await, threads, concurrent data structures.


3. Advanced Features
- Error Handling and Safety: exceptions, errors. safety features such as ownership, python dynamic and reflective capabilities

- Networking and I/O: I/O calls, networking, user interactio


4. Modularity and Reusability
- Modules and Namespaces: Modules, namespaces, packaging etc.

- Object-Oriented Features: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation

- Metaprogramming and Generics: programs that generate code and type safety with generics


5. Compilation and Runtime
- Compilation/Interpretation

- Runtime Environment


6. Ecosystem
- Standard library

- Package manager
